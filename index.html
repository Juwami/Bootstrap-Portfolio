                <p>My name is Sean Tumulak-Nguyen and I grew up in Anchorage, Alaska. Over the years, I moved due to
                    my parents' divorces and remarries, which ultimately led me to put my "Start" line here in
                    Charlotte, NC.
                <p>I enjoy going to the gym and working up a sweat. The downside is I do not eat
                    well enough to show for my effort in the gym. I know I eat horribly, but food is too good! I
                    think of all things I enjoy is to be against the majority, but still have the capabilities to be
                    a part of the majority if I so choose. For example, there are very few people who would confess
                    to reading "The Satanic Bible" just because they are curious of the mindset. Psst...it's in my
                    nightstand and I'm not finished.</p>
                <p>More importantly, I am attending this bootcamp to be more
                    marketable in the workspace. I currently have six years of experience as a Systems Administrator
                    and wanted to gain the knowledge to progress in a line toward DevOps however I am taking one
                    step at a time. Hopefully at the end of this course, I learn the skillset and knowledge to
                    progress a few more stepping stones.</p>
